# Prestashop Database Documentation

## What is this?

This project aims at documenting the database design of PrestaShop in an easy to
understand way.

## Why are you doing it?

Every single job I had for the last 5 years made me (in one way or another) deal
with PrestaShop and all the idiocy involved in the project. I'm getting very
tired at debugging the database over and over again, so I figured out I'd
write *somewhere* my findings.

## Why not a paid PDF instead of a free GitHub repo?

Because making money by selling books about the bad design of an idiotic project
is not my cup of tea. Also, have you actually seen PrestaShop's database? That
thing is <b>huge</b>. I'm hoping people joining me at some point...

## What version of Prestashop will you cover?

Right now I'm trying to document `1.6.x`. Past and future versions will follow
depending on contributions, spare time, and most importantly, the time I'm
forced to spend with PrestaShop.
